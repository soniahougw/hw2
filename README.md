"When Fish Met Chocochip" is a simple fishing game that I designed. At first, I planned to create fish swimming in a pond and have players use a rod to catch them in a bucket. However, to make the concept simpler and more playful, I decided to use a chocolate chip as the fishing rod. Players catch the fish by clicking on them with the mouse.
Instead of dividing the canvas in half and restricting the fish’s movement, I replaced the entire background with an ocean scene. I exported the fish images as picture files first, then imported them into the code to minimize potential errors when randomizing their speed, size, and flipping direction when they hit the canvas edge. The fish disappear once clicked—signifying that they’ve been caught by the player (the chocochip).
Because the fish move at random speeds, I tested the game numerous times to ensure that the number of fish and the time limit created a balanced level of difficulty. The screen design changes depending on whether the player wins or loses, adding emotional variety to the gameplay. Additionally, I incorporated a “cookie-biting” sound effect when catching fish to make the experience more engaging. The background features underwater sound effects, along with distinct sounds for winning and losing, to further enhance the overall atmosphere.
